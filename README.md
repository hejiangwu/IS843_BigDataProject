### **Project objective:**<br>
Our exploration will enable us to identify taxi trip patterns in NYC and develop strategies accordingly to improve revenue for taxi drivers and taxi companies.

We combined datasets from 2018 to 2021 to draw more insight from our analysis. As data from 2020 onwards show the impact of the pandemic on taxi demand, providing information from the two years prior to the pandemic would lead to a more accurate interpretation of results.

For Phase 1 of our project we explored the data to understand commonalities in demand, depending on year, month, day of the week, time of the day and location. In Phase 2 we utilized our findings to discern further how those factors affect revenue.<br>


### **Motivation:**<br>
Taxi market has been facing great competition in recent years, as an increasing number of people switch from taxi to share-riding, such as Uber and Lyft, as a means of transportation. While taxi companies and drivers may have a hard time going through this transition, there are people who prefer and need to take taxis. By analyzing taxi trip patterns in NYC, we will help taxi companies and drivers learn more about the customers they're serving and, more importantly, how to increase revenue to stay in business.<br>



### **Report Summary:**<br>
We cleaned the dataframe to exclude unrepresentative data points and created features that better fit the purpose of our analyses. We conducted exploratory data analysis on taxi trip demand patterns, revenue patterns, and how they interrelate to one another. We also implemented machine learning methods, including linear regression, random forest, and GBT regression, to predict taxi trip price based on other features.

The analysis revealed that taxi trips were most popular during the morning and afternoon hours. Short-distance trips were the most popular, with the most frequently traveled routes being in the upper east and upper west side, spanning 66 blocks. Long trips were found to be the most expensive per minute. In terms of difference in demand based on the day of the week; Friday has the highest demand, while Sunday has the lowest.
